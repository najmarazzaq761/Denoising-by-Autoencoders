# Denoising MNIST Images using Autoencoders

This repository contains a project focused on denoising images from the MNIST dataset using autoencoders. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The project demonstrates the application of autoencoders for removing noise from images and improving digit classification accuracy.

## Overview

### Dataset
- **MNIST**: A dataset comprising grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### Task
- **Denoising Images**: Using autoencoders to remove noise from images, enhancing the clarity and quality of the digit representations.

## Models and Techniques
This project employs various deep learning models and techniques, including:
- **Denoising Autoencoders**: Training autoencoders to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, capturing essential features for denoising.
- **Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE)**: Leveraging the power of convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images and improve denoising performance.
- **Noise Augmentation**: Adding different types and levels of noise to the images to train robust denoising models.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implementing dropout and batch normalization to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.
